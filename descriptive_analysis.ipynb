    "# FLIGHT DATA — DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS VISUALIZATION\n",
    "\n",
    "This document contains a Python script that performs **descriptive analysis** on a flight operations dataset and produces a set of visualizations. The text below explains, step-by-step, the analysis process so you (or any teammate) can understand the intent behind each code block and reproduce or extend it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook/script is to answer the descriptive question **\"What happened?\"** by summarizing flight volumes, cancellations, delays, and operational metrics (taxi times, air time, distance) across time and origin airports.\n",
    "\n",
    "This file is organized into clearly labeled sections: data loading & cleaning, basic statistics, volume visualizations, cancellation analysis, delay analysis, airport performance, distributions, and combined delay distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step-by-step explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Load & inspect the data\n",
    "- Action: `pd.read_csv(\"flights_data_2024.csv\")` and convert `fl_date` to `datetime`.\n",
    "- Why: ensures date operations are possible and gives a quick check for malformed dates.\n",
    "- Tip: after loading, run `df.info()` and `df.head()` interactively to inspect data types and sample rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Basic cleaning\n",
    "- Action: `dropna` on essential columns: `origin`, `dep_time`, `distance`, `air_time`.\n",
    "- Why: these fields are required for most descriptive metrics — rows missing them can't contribute to the core visualizations.\n",
    "- Note: we fill missing delay columns (`weather_delay`, `late_aircraft_delay`) with 0 because NaN usually indicates \"no delay recorded\" rather than an unknown value in many operational datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Basic statistics\n",
    "- Action: print total flights, cancelled flights, and average distance.\n",
    "- Why: quick KPIs are useful to orient the audience before diving into visualizations.\n",
    "- Recommendation: Save these KPI values into a small report table if you want to present them in dashboards or exported CSVs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Flight volume visualizations\n",
    "- Flights per month: bar chart of counts grouped by `month`.\n",
    "  - Purpose: identify seasonal patterns and peak travel months.\n",
    "- Flights per day-of-week: bar chart using `day_of_week` mapped to weekdays.\n",
    "  - Purpose: find weekly operational patterns (e.g., weekends vs weekdays).\n",
    "- Implementation notes: use `groupby('month').size()` or `value_counts()` depending on the grouping.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5) Cancellation analysis\n",
    "- Plot monthly cancellation rate: compute mean of `cancelled` per month and multiply by 100 for percentage.\n",
    "- Purpose: see whether cancellations spike in particular months (e.g., winter months for weather-related cancellations).\n",
    "- Additional idea: break down cancellations by `origin_state_nm` or `origin` for geographic context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6) Delay analysis\n",
    "- Compute average `weather_delay` and `late_aircraft_delay` per month and plot as line charts.\n",
    "- Purpose: compare cause types across the year to see which months are dominated by weather vs late-aircraft.\n",
    "- Advanced: add `carrier_delay` or `security_delay` columns if available, and plot stacked area charts to show contribution to total delay.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7) Airport performance\n",
    "- Identify top N busiest `origin` airports and compute mean taxi times and delay metrics for them.\n",
    "- Purpose: quickly compare operational metrics across major hubs to find congestion points.\n",
    "- Tip: sorting by flight volumes first helps keep the analysis focused on airports that matter operationally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8) Distribution of air time & distance\n",
    "- Plot histogram for `air_time` to understand typical flight durations and long-tail behavior.\n",
    "- Scatter plot `distance` vs `air_time` to inspect route efficiency and detect outliers (e.g., very long air_time for short distance might indicate diversion or holding patterns).\n",
    "- Recommendation: sample large datasets for scatter plots (`df.sample(5000)`) to keep plotting fast and responsive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9) Combined delay distribution\n",
    "- Boxplots for delay columns to visually compare spread, medians and outliers between delay types.\n",
    "- Purpose: identify whether one type of delay typically contributes larger outliers (e.g., late aircraft causing very large delays on some days)."

    "### Airport Performance — Taxi-Out vs Weather Delay (Top 10 Origins)\n",
    "\n",
    "Overview\n",
    "- The two charts show, for the top 10 busiest origin airports, (1) average taxi-out time and (2) average weather-related delay (minutes).\n",
    "- Together they help distinguish airports where ground congestion (long taxi-out) is the main operational drag from airports where weather is the primary delay driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key patterns to look for\n",
    "- High taxi-out, low weather delay:\n",
    "    - Indicates surface congestion, traffic management, runway/taxiway capacity limits, or gate/ground handling bottlenecks.\n",
    "    - Typical causes: peak-hour queuing, runway throughput constraints, limited apron/gate availability, or inefficient pushback sequencing.\n",
    "- Low taxi-out, high weather delay:\n",
    "    - Points toward meteorological impacts (fog, wind, snow, deicing) rather than ground congestion.\n",
    "    - Suggests that operational improvements on the ground will have limited effect until weather impacts are mitigated or scheduled for.\n",
    "- High both taxi-out and weather delay:\n",
    "    - Compound problem: bad weather amplifies existing surface capacity issues and makes recovery slower.\n",
    "    - These airports are high-priority for both infrastructure and weather-response planning.\n",
    "- Low both:\n",
    "    - Indicates smooth operations for the period analyzed — good capacity buffer, effective ground ops, and benign weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operational insights & implications\n",
    "- Prioritize interventions where taxi-out dominates:\n",
    "    - Investigate peak-hour scheduling and consider redistributing flights, staggering pushback windows, or optimizing taxi routing.\n",
    "    - Review apron and gate utilization; improve turnaround coordination and ground-handling staffing during peaks.\n",
    "    - Use targeted operational metrics (median taxi-out, 90th percentile) to avoid being misled by mean values that outliers inflate.\n",
    "- For weather-driven delays:\n",
    "    - Enhance weather forecasting and decision-support for proactive deicing, runway configuration changes, and contingency staffing.\n",
    "    - Coordinate with carriers to adjust buffer times in schedules for known weather-prone windows.\n",
    "- For airports with both issues:\n",
    "    - Combine short-term tactical responses (dynamic ground sequencing, additional ground crews) with medium-term capacity fixes (taxiway/ramp layout, runway alternates).\n",
    "- Use carrier- and time-of-day breakdowns:\n",
    "    - Some carriers or specific time windows may cause disproportionate taxi-out or delay impacts—target these with operational agreements or schedule changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bottom line\n",
    "- The two charts together give a clear first-pass triage: identify airports where operational fixes on the ground will yield the biggest gains versus those requiring weather resilience measures. Focus immediate operational efforts on airports with high taxi-out (reduce surface congestion) and schedule/infrastructure investments where delays are persistent and weather-amplified."

    "### Distribution of Air Time (Histogram)\n",
    "\n",
    "- What the chart shows  \n",
    "    - The histogram displays the frequency of flights by air time (minutes). Most flights cluster around shorter durations with a long right tail of less frequent, long-duration flights.\n",
    "- Key characteristics to note  \n",
    "    - Central tendency: a clear peak (mode) at shorter flight durations — typical short-haul service dominates the sample.  \n",
    "    - Skew: right-skewed distribution indicating a long tail of long-haul flights and a small number of extreme values.  \n",
    "    - Outliers: a few flights with very high air times relative to the bulk of the data.\n",
    "- Practical insight / actions  \n",
    "    - Use median and percentiles (P50, P75, P90) rather than the mean to summarize typical air time because the mean is pulled by the long tail.  \n",
    "    - Investigate extreme long air-time observations (outliers) to confirm whether they are long-haul routes, diversions, data errors, or in-flight holding.\n",

    "### Distance vs Air Time (Scatter, sampled)\n",
    "\n",
    "- What the chart shows  \n",
    "    - A positive relationship between distance and air time: generally, longer distances correspond to longer air times. The points form an upward-trending cloud, but with notable spread.\n",
    "- Key patterns to inspect  \n",
    "    - Linear trend with variance: most points follow a roughly linear trend (distance ∝ air time), but dispersion increases with distance.  \n",
    "    - Short-distance variability: for short routes, air time varies more proportionally (takeoff/landing and taxi margins are larger relative to cruise).  \n",
    "    - Outliers: points with high air time but short distance (possible holding/diversions) and points with low air time for long distance (potential data quality issues or tailwinds/operational shortcuts).\n",
    "- Practical insight / actions  \n",
    "    - Compute average cruise speed per route (distance / air_time) to detect inefficient routes or inconsistent flight profiles.  \n",
    "    - Flag and audit outliers: investigate flights with unusually high air time for short distances (diversions, delays, or misreported distance) and unusually low air time for long flights (data errors).  \n",
    "    - Fit a robust regression (e.g., RANSAC or Theil–Sen) to estimate expected air time by distance and use residuals to prioritize operational investigations.  \n",
    "    - For planning: use route-level typical air times (median) to set schedules and buffer times; use outlier analysis to improve reliability and fuel planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combined takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "- The histogram confirms the dataset is dominated by short-haul flights with a long-tail of long-haul operations.  \n",
    "- The scatter confirms distance largely explains air time but also reveals variability and outliers that signal operational events or data issues.  \n",
    "- Next steps: quantify typical values with percentiles, calculate route-level speeds, and investigate flagged outliers to improve schedule accuracy, operational efficiency, and data quality."

    "\n",
    "What the chart shows\n",
    "- The horizontal boxplots compare the distributions of weather_delay and late_aircraft_delay (minutes).\n",
    "- late_aircraft_delay exhibits a notably higher median and wider IQR than weather_delay, and far more extreme upper outliers.\n",

    "\n",
    "Interpretation\n",
    "- Late-aircraft delays are the dominant and more frequent source of long delays in this sample (higher typical value and more extreme cases).\n",
    "- Weather delays are generally smaller for most flights but occasionally cause big disruptions — these are less frequent but high-impact events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actionable insight\n",
    "- Prioritize operational fixes targeting late-aircraft delays for the largest near-term reduction in average delay minutes (improve turnarounds, recovery procedures, maintenance and crew scheduling).\n",
